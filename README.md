# The Gebeta Game
#### _What it is_
A traditional Gebeta game, that has been played by Ethiopian youth for God knows how long, is now here in your Java command line. YAYYYYYYYYYY!!!! 
#### _How to play_

Unfortunatly for now, the following are your playing holes, all with 4 rocks ready setup for you to start the game.

`4|4|4|4|4|4`

`4|4|4|4|4|4`

 just choose the hole number and hit Enter... the game will automatically take all the stones from your selected hole and drop them, one at a time, into holes to its right. That is it.
 
**p.s run Main.Java :)**
